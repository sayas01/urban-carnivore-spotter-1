      <p>The Seattle Urban Carnivore project is a partnership between Woodland Park Zoo and Seattle University and aims to explore how mammalian carnivores live and interact with people across urban and suburban areas in the Seattle region.</p>
      <p>The project focuses on the following species:</p>
      <ul>
        <li className={classes.bulleted}>Black Bear</li>
        <li className={classes.bulleted}>Bobcat</li>
        <li className={classes.bulleted}>Cougar / Mountain Lion</li>
        <li className={classes.bulleted}>Coyote</li>
        <li className={classes.bulleted}>Opossum</li>
        <li className={classes.bulleted}>Raccoon</li>
        <li className={classes.bulleted}>River Otter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are terrestrial (not marine) mammals in the taxonomic order Carnivora (*except for opossums). Some of them have a carnivorous diet (eating other animals). Many of them, however, have an omnivorous diet, eating plants as well as animals.</p>
      <p>You can use this observation form to submit observations of any of the above animals (or if you think you may have seen one of them, but arenâ€™t sure!)</p>
